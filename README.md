# Chemistry end of year assignment
I created this website because I wanted a fun/creative media for my end of year reflection assignment
## Assignment:
make/write/draw a short on-page overview in which you outline what benefit â€“if any- learning about chemistry had in your (personal) life, so life outside of school, and for you as a member of society. You will be assessed on Crit. D.
