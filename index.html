                  <p >Chemistry as a subject is not a really big part of my daily life (other then the fact that everything depends on itüòÖ).
                      But the methods of problem solving taught during class and approach do help me alot in my daily
                      life. I tend to overthink problems aliot and I actually have been pushing myself to break
                      a problem up in multiple different problems/questions and solve them individually to finally
                      solve the problem as a whole. Although this is not chemistry specific I think it really helps me in my persona/social life.
                      As for pure chemistry, it currently does not have an appliance in my life. 
                      I know that chemistry is always present and it does help me understand why some things occur/happen
                      and I have noticed myself think sometimes ‚Äúcould that be because of ‚Ä¶‚Äù. But it does not help me in practical way
                      or make my life easier.
