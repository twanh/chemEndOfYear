                  <p >Chemistry as a subject is not a really big part of my daily life (other then the fact that everything depends on it😅).
                      But the methods of problem solving taught during class and approach do help me alot in my daily
                      life. I tend to overthink problems aliot and I actually have been pushing myself to break
                      a problem up in multiple different problems/questions and solve them individually to finally
                      solve the problem as a whole. Although this is not chemistry specific I think it really helps me in my persona/social life.
                      As for pure chemistry, it currently does not have an appliance in my life. 
                      I know that chemistry is always present and it does help me understand why some things occur/happen
                      and I have noticed myself think sometimes “could that be because of …”. But it does not help me in practical way
                      or make my life easier.

                    <p >This chemistry year has definitely taught me a lot in term of chemistry and science in general.
                        Not only have I learned about a variety of chemistry topics but also about scientific thinking 
                        and reasoning. This is not only useful during chemistry but also during physics. 
                        I have also noticed that there is a lot of overlap between the scientific subjects and math. 
                        For example the unit calculations relied very much on math but in a chemistry context.
                        Even more for physics, physics this year required a lot of math.
                        In other regard, I have not noticed many similarities between physics and chemistry. 
                        I can image there is a bigger overlap with biology though. I do think that the fact that some topics are taught 
                        in two different ways in two subjects complicates things a bit but this applies more the physics 
                        then it does to chemistry.

                    <p >The role of chemistry but more science in general in society in my opinion is quite big.
                        Everything we know is based on chemistry, physics and/or biology. The role of society in
                        me learning chemistry is not that big, of course because chemistry is well supported in 
                        the netherlands and accepted as a important science there is a lot of support and being 
                        good/knowing chemistry in this current society might bring a lot of opportunities. 
                        But since I am not that interested in pursuing a career in chemistry that does not play a 
                        role in my personal development in chemistry.                         
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Having said that I do believe chemistry is an important subject. 
                        Especially since it does help you understand a lot of important concepts to understand to world we live in. 
                        Which definitely something I am interested in. This year my understanding of chemistry definitely has grown 
                        and so had my interest in it. Before, I thought of chemistry as just another subject but I have 
                        grown to actually quite like it and find the topics discussed interesting (not to say I am good at it).
